# Who-any-one-who-have-file-custom-emc-all-item-can-get-in-Minecraft-
hey everybody does anyone have custom emc files for mods like (Cyclic,Thermal Foundation,Thermal Expansion,extrautils2,exnihilo, creation,Ex Compressum,tiny progressions) and all item can get in Minecraft i need help to complete lite mod pack, in the process of creating my own mod pack combining survival with technological devices and ancient magic, I found project e it is great and it can combine even better when there is custom emc files for the mods I listed above, I almost found the right custom file from Stone Block 2 when it adds emc value to blaze powder,ender eyes and emc for almost all magic wands in Cyclic mod but there is a problem about the conversion table with some 3 dot force the item is red (sorry but I forgot the name of it) but to craft the table it costs more than 9,000 emc points is it reasonable right?  but when combining it with stone and obsidian its emc price goes up to more than 9m ðŸ«¡ and it's even more terrible when combining the conversion table with stone and obsidian one more time it will become a table that can be used in inventory and its price is 300g ðŸ˜± i want to test myself and want to have the best experience but it makes me lose motivation anymore, think instead of farming to craft machines i just need to find a few materials and i can earn a ton of emc i want to have a great experience so i'm still looking for a custom file that adds emc value to all crafted items in Minecraft and also values for the mods i mentioned above!
